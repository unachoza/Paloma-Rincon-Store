        <p>
          Paloma is a Madrid based, Mexican born, photographer working worldwide, from experimental and personal
          projects to commercial assignments for big companies. <br />
          She creates visual games in the intersection where photography meets sculpture, design, instalation or
          illustration. With a playful and contemporary aesthetic approach, the resulting images showcase interesting
          worlds where shapes, textures, materials, lights and color blend together living in harmony inside fine, rich,
          and detailed graphic compositions. <br />
          Paloma´s photographic images are captured after a very thorough process that starts with the main idea and
          it´s creative developement. It is followed by a careful selection of props with a graphic and sleek set design
          in an abstraction of reality through the use of practical but decontextualized elements. She plays with the
          viewers perception juxtaposing unconnected objects redefining their meaning. <br />
          Paloma combines an accurate use of technique and the creativity of a craftsman. Playing with reality, the
          beauty of handcraft recovers its value and magic.&nbsp;

          “Her work updates the tradition of the still life to the digital, advertising age. And it’s so hashtag
          aesthetic— no momento mori here; instead, Rincón is interested in bright colors and fascinating forms, with
          palpable textures and absurd juxtapositioning. She’s a photographer, but also the author of the formal
          compositions her lens captures” –The Creators Project - VICE{" "}
